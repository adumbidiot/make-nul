# make-nul
A program that makes a file called NUL on the current user's desktop for personal amusement. 
This works on Windows only. Make sure you know the consequences of running this program before running it. 
I will take no responsibility for whatever happens as a result of running this program.
This program was inspired by an openssl-rs build that went horribly wrong.
